Explanation of what does this folders and files:
"engine" folder is folder with LOVE2d engine, if you want, you can update it to last version.
"final" folder is folder where your compiled game will appear.
"compile.bat" script that will compile your game.
"readme.txt" file that you're reading right now.

A: Just follow this steps:

Step 1. Preparing.

Create .zip archive with game source code.
Name it "game.zip", and put it in folder with compile.bat

Step 2. Compile.
Launch "compile.bat" and follow the instructions.

Step 3. Profit.
Open the "final" folder.
If you did everything right, there will be .dll files and "game.exe"
You can rename "game.exe", if you want, or change icon and other stuff.
